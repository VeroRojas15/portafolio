        <h3>"Curiosity is the first step towards knowledge."</h3>
         <p>I am a young woman passionate about technology and everything related to IT. Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the vast world of information technologies. Currently, I am studying at the Escuela Superior de Cómputo (ESCOM) at IPN, 
            where each day motivates me even more to pursue a career in information security and data privacy.<br/><br/>
            My journey is just beginning, and each day is an opportunity to learn and grow. For me, information security goes beyond mere data protection; it is a constant challenge that demands creativity and technical skills. 
            I am excited to explore new tools and techniques that will allow me to contribute to a safer digital environment.</p>

                    <h3>Whitfield Diffie</h3>
                    <p>Born in 1944, is one of the most influential cryptographers in the history of modern cryptography. In 2015, he was awarded with the Turing Award for his significant contributions to the field.<br/><br/>
                        He graduated in 1965 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he developed an interest in computation theory and information security. Throughout his career, 
                        he worked at key institutions such as Bell Labs and Sun Microsystems, driving advancements in digital security.<br/><br/>
                        His most notable contribution was "public key cryptography," a concept that revolutionized security by enabling secure message exchange without the need to share a secret key beforehand. In 1976, along with Martin Hellman, 
                        he published the paper "New Directions in Cryptography," where they introduced the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This method allowed encryption keys to be securely shared over insecure channels, a fundamental breakthrough for modern cryptography.<br/><br/>
                        Diffie’s work laid the foundation for systems such as SSL/TLS, which secures web communication, and PGP, which protects email. He also served as Vice President of Information Security and Cryptography at ICANN, where he continued advancing digital security.</p>

                    <h3>Feistel Encryption Algorithm</h3>
                    <p>Developed by Horst Feistel in the 1970s while working at IBM (Insternational Business Machines), is the foundation for many modern symmetric encryption algorithms, including DES (Data Encryption Standard). This cryptographic scheme 
                        uses a structure where a plaintext block is divided into two halves; one half is encrypted while the other is iteratively combined with a key. This process is repeated multiple times, resulting in a robust encryption.<br/><br/>
                        One of the key advantages of the Feistel algorithm is that decryption follows the same procedure as encryption, but in reverse order, simplifying its implementation. DES, developed in collaboration with Feistel, was the international 
                        cryptographic standard for decades, protecting sensitive data in banks and governments, until it was replaced by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) due to vulnerabilities to brute-force attacks.<br/><br/>
                        The impact of the Feistel scheme has been significant, marking a milestone in the creation of secure and efficient symmetric ciphers, and it remains a fundamental structure in many modern encryption algorithms.</p>

                    <h3>Diffie-Hellman Protocol</h3>
                    <p>In 1976, the Diffie-Hellman protocol was created by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. This protocol introduced the concept of key exchange over an insecure channel, representing a significant advancement in communication security.<br/><br/>
                        Before Diffie-Hellman, sharing secret keys required secure and complicated methods. The protocol allows two parties to generate a shared key without exchanging it directly, using complex mathematical functions that ensure the privacy of the process.<br/><br/>
                        Based on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem, the protocol is secure against interception attempts. This innovation facilitated the development of public key cryptography, which enables secure communications without the risk of a key being discovered.<br/><br/>
                        The introduction of the Diffie-Hellman protocol laid the foundation for many modern security systems, including secure internet connections and virtual private networks (VPNs). Its impact remains fundamental in the protection of data in digital environments today. </p>               </div>
